# Extension API

Lean Stats exposes extension points for adding admin panels, REST sources, and analytics behavior overrides.

## Admin panel extensions

Custom admin panels register a React component on `window.LeanStatsAdminPanels` and declare the panel via the `lean_stats_admin_panels` filter. Panels receive the existing admin shell and render inside the Lean Stats dashboard.

## REST source extensions

Custom REST data sources register on `lean_stats_rest_sources` and are implemented via the `lean_stats_register_rest_sources` action. The admin UI consumes the declared sources automatically.

## Analytics behavior filters

Lean Stats applies filters for cache TTL, deduplication, rate limiting, raw log retention, and maximum raw log size. See `docs/HOOKS.md` for the full list and examples.
